# Exo 1: Return to the basics

Well, you already done it once, but it's a good practice. You'll need to able to do this exercise before move on to the others.

Try to do the famoso 'my_swap' of the Day04 of your amazing CPool.

#warn(If you're not able to do this exercise, you need to call an AER or a Pedago, he will help you with pleasure (except for Lucas...))

# Exo 2: Ready for the next step ?

Now that you know the basics, let's try to do something a little bit more complicated.

In this exercise, instead of swaping two integers, you'll swap two strings and print them. You must do only one function. Your function must be prototyped as follows:

```c
void my_swap_str(char *first_string, char *second_string);
```

# Exo 3: Step by step, don't need to run

Something new ?

Write a function that finds the smallest value in an integer array passed as a parameter. It should be prototyped as follows:

```c
void find_min_array(int *tab);
```

# Exo 3: Ah ****, here we go again...

Write a function that finds the greatest value in an integer array passed as a parameter. It should be prototyped as follows:

```c
void find_max_array(int *tab);
```
