# Exo 1: Return to the basics

Well, you already done it once, but it's a good practice. You'll need to able to do this exercise before move on to the others.

Try to do the famoso 'my_print_alpha' of the Day01 of your amazing CPool.

#warn(If you're not able to do this exercise, you need to call an AER or a Pedago, he will help you with pleasure (except for Lucas...))

# Exo 2: Ready for the next step ?

Now that you know the real real basics, let's try to do something a little bit more complicated.

In this exercise, you'll write a function that print all even numbers, starting by 0, in ascending order until you reach the number passed as parameter. Your function must be prototyped as follows:

```c
void my_even(int limit);
```

# Exo 3: String, you know that ?

We worked with different types of variable, but we did not touch the strings. It's time for it.

Write a function that displays each uppercase letter found in a string passed as a parameter. It should be prototyped as follows:

```c
void my_upper_print(char *str);
```
