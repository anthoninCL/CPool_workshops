# Exo 1: Let's get started

Well, you need to start somewhere, so we'll do something quite easy.

Try to do unit tests for the 'my_strlen' function.

#hint(You do not have a 'my_strlen', well, go ahead, it's time to do it!)

#warn(If you're not able to do this exercise, you need to call an AER or a Pedago, he will help you with pleasure (except for Lucas...))

# Exo 2: Ready for the next step ?

Now that you know the real real basics, let's try to check condition.

Try to do unit tests for the 'my_isneg' function.

#hint(You do not have a 'my_isneg', well, go ahead, it's time to do it!)

# Exo 3: How do we test output ?

Sometimes, you will print stuff on an output, and yes, you can test those things.

Try to do unit tests for the 'my_putstr' function.

#hint(You do not have a 'my_putstr', well, go ahead, it's time to do it!)

# Exo 4: Too easy ?

Okay, those are small functions with few branches and lines. But sometimes, it won't be so easy. Let's try something a little bit more complicated.

Try to do unit tests for the 'my_compute_factorial_it' function.

#hint(You do not have a 'my_compute_factorial_it', well, go ahead, it's time to do it!)
